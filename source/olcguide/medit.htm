<p><font size="2"><a name="medit1"></a>Challenging mobiles fill an area with life 
  and population, giving it characters of its own for players to interact with 
  or kill. Medit commands are accessed by typing &quot;medit [existing mob vnum 
  in area]&quot; or &quot;medit create [new mobile vnum in area]&quot;<br>
  Commands are as follows:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>commands:</strong><br>
  Lists the commands for medit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>medit create [new 
  vnum]:</strong><br>
  Using a new vnum, the medit editor creates a new mobile, placing the builder 
  into Medit mode for that mobile.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>show:</strong><br>
  Shows medit stats of the mobile. This same command can also be accomplished 
  by just hitting &lt;enter&gt; on a blank line.</font></p>
</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<p><font size="2"><strong>?:</strong><br>
  Lists the types of in-context OLC help files one may view.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>version: </strong><br>
  Shows the credits and current version of our OLC editor.</font></p>
</font> 
<hr>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ac [# # # #]<br>
  armor [#pierce #bash #slash #exotic]:</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <font size="2">Sets the mobile's armour class - ac [pierce] [bash] [slash] [exotic]. 
  Make sure it is negative and not positive.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>act [flags]:</strong><br>
  Sets the basic action types for the mobile, a fixed default being &quot;NPC&quot;. 
  Things such as aggressive, cleric, or scavenger are under act. Type &quot;? 
  act&quot; for a listing of possible actions.</font></p>
</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>affect [flags]:</strong><br>
  Sets what the mobile is affected by, such as haste, flying, or blind. Type &quot;? 
  affect&quot; to see a list of possible affect spells that the mobile can use.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>alignment [number]:</strong><br>
  Sets the alignment of the mobile, from pure evil (-1000) to angelic (1000). 
  Keep in mind that low level mobiles should lean more toward neutral than some 
  higher level mobs, to keep people from radically changing their align just on 
  the basis of their kills.</font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>damdice [#d#bonus]:</strong><br>
  Sets the damage that the mobile can do, based on a dice roll with added bonus. 
  Check &#8220;help levelchart1&#8221; to &#8220;help levelchart5&#8221; for an 
  idea of what you should have; don't make a level 1 mob that can deal 1000 damage 
  a hit. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>damtype [damnoun]:</strong><br>
  Sets the default damage noun of the mobile, if it isn't wielding a weapon. See 
  &quot;? weapon&quot; for a list of nouns and the names you can use to set them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>desc:</strong><br>
  Places the builder into the text append mode, like room descriptions, except 
  that this is to set the mobile's description, what the player sees when they 
  type &quot;look [mobile]&quot;. Same editor commands as for the redit append 
  mode.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>form [flags]:</strong><br>
  Sets the form of the mobile, such as sentient (capable of thought) or biped. 
  For a list of flags, type &quot;? form&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>group [group number]:</strong><br>
  Set with other mobiles of a different type, this sets a group number that the 
  mobile belongs to for purposes of assisting his fellows.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>hitdice [#d#+bonus]: 
  </strong><br>
  Sets the hitpoints of the mob, based on a roll of a specific number of x-sided 
  dice. See &#8220;help levelchart1&#8221; to &#8220;help levelchart5&#8221; to 
  get a general idea of the range your mobile should have for hitdice.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>hitroll [number]:</strong><br>
  Sets a hit roll bonus for the mob. Keep to a modest amount, so that players 
  might have an equal chance at hitting the mob as it has at them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>imm/res/vuln [flags]:</strong><br>
  Sets the immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities of the mobs. Please don't 
  set too many immunities or resistances without balancing a few vulnerabilities 
  in with it to balance it out. Mobs will be tested.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>level [number]:</strong><br>
  Sets the level of the mobile. Please keep in a 1 to 100 range, and keep in mind 
  the level range your area is for.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>long 
  [string]:</strong><br>
  Sets the long description of the mobile, what the players will see when they 
  walk into a room with the mobile already in it. Examples: &quot;A city guard 
  protects his post.&quot; or other such brief, appropriate messages.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>manadice [#d#+bonus]:</strong><br>
  For spell casting mobs, sets the mana that they have.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>material [word]:</strong><br>
  Sets the material for the mob, such as flesh, skin_and_bones, rock, whatnot. 
  When using multiple words, DO NOT PUT SPACES BETWEEN THE WORDS. Instead, use 
  the underscore (_) key to connect the words, as spaces in the material zork 
  the mud and cause it to hang up or crash.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>name [key words]:</strong><br>
  Sets the key word names for the mobile, the words that a character would type 
  to get a response from the mobile. Examples are &quot;city guard&quot; or &quot;healer&quot;. 
  Keep it to 3 words, if you can help it, less.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>off [flags]: </strong><br>
  Sets offensive flags, such as area_attack, that the mobile uses in a fight. 
  Type &quot;? off&quot; for a list of useable flags.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>part [flags]:</strong><br>
  Sets the parts of the mobile, such as arms, legs, guts, head, whatnot. &quot;? 
  part&quot; will give you a list of parts that you can use.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>position start [position]<br>
  position default [position]:</strong><br>
  Sitting, resting, standing, or sleeping, the four standard positions. The start 
  position is how the mobile will be when it repops, and the default is the position 
  it will return to after a fight.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>race [race]:</strong><br>
  Looking at &quot;race ?&quot; under OLC help, (race ?, not ? race), you can 
  set the race of the mobile, and thus effectively cut down on manually setting 
  parts and certain affects. Old Diku races, as well as Prophecy's human races, 
  are all listed in &quot;race ?&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>sex [male/female/neutral/random]:</strong><br>
  Sets the gender of the mobile. Random sets the gender randomly upon mob repop 
  in the area.</font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>short [string]:</strong><br>
  Sets a short string that a player sees while fighting, or talking to a mobile.<br>
  Examples are &quot;A Guard&quot; or &quot;The healer&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>size [size flags]:</strong><br>
  Sets the size of the mobile, affecting how well it fights against a character, 
  allowing it certain bonuses. Tiny would be a mouse, small for birds, medium 
  for human, large, huge, and giant, for anything else on that sort of scale. 
  Only one size may be set, so see &quot;? size &quot; for the listing of sizes 
  you can use.</font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>spec spec_[special 
  function name]:</strong><br>
  Sets one pre-coded special function for the mobile, such as spec_alorn_guard. 
  For a list of special functions, type &quot;? spec&quot;. To remove the spec, 
  type &quot;spec none&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>wealth [number in 
  SILVER]:</strong><br>
  Sets the amount of money the mobile is carrying, in silver. If you want the 
  mob to carry a little bit of gold, remember the exchange rate is 100 silver 
  per gold, but the editor will mix it up some, so you could have 20 gold and 
  4000 silver upon autogolding a mob.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u><a name="mprog"></a>Adding 
  mprogs</u></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>addmprog [vnum of 
  mprog] [trigger] [%]</strong><br>
  Sets an mprog with given vnum, to the trigger at % of the time. Such as: &quot;Addmprog 
  250 grall 100&quot; will set mprog 250 to the mob, greeting all who come in 
  100% of the time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>delmprog [number 
  on list]:</strong><br>
  Removes an mprog from the list. First, type &quot;show&quot; or hit &lt;enter&gt; 
  on a blank line, and look at the far left column for the mprog number on the 
  list, starting with 0 and going up in 1 number increments as mprogs are added.</font></p>
