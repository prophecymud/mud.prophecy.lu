<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><strong>Compiled 
  rules from &quot;changes&quot; board</strong></font></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't use the addapply 
    commands to apply perm_spells, use addaffect &lt;spellname&gt; &lt;level&gt;, 
    i.e. addaffect haste 50</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Immunity to sleep for 
    mobs will render them immune to both the sleep spell and sap attacks</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'if class' works for 
    both mprogs and oprogs </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dam_noun groups were 
    looked at and listed, you can find them by typing help dam_types or help damtypes</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Saveover flags can be 
    used on rooms and items. A saveover room will save all items in it over a 
    reboot/crash and a saveover item will stay in the rooms it's in over a reboot/crash</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Keyrings can be made 
    and are quite much like containers</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Emily was brought in 
    here, don't tamper with her or try to make her throw quests</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Oedit delete, medit 
    delete and redit delete were brought it. They all take a vnum as argument 
    (i.e., in medit, delete #) and will permanently delete a room/object/mobile 
    from an area. Note that while it isn't a problem if you delete a room while 
    you're in it, it transfers you to recall (Temple of UL), but since it transfers 
    you to recall (Temple of UL), and doesn&#8217;t remove you from &quot;editor 
    mode&quot;, it then (naturally, unless you are listed as a Sendar builder) 
    tells you that you have insufficient OLC rights, and boots you out of &quot;editor 
    mode&quot;). It's a lot easier to do it remotely.</font> </li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 'isquested' check 
    was put in and it only works if the person is in a scrimmage or quested (a 
    must to use for clanhalls, same with the violence check 'violent')</font></li>
</ul>
