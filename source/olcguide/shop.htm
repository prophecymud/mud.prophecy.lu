<strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Creating Shops in Areas 
</font></strong> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shops provide another opportunity 
  for players to acquire items, rather than having to kill for them, but also 
  a place where they can sell items of their own to the shopkeeper.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First and foremost, <strong>medit 
  the vnum of the mobile</strong> you wish to be the shopkeeper.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1) Shop Assign</strong><br>
  This will assign a shop to the mobile, the very first command used for the purpose 
  of placing a shop using this mobile.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2) Shop Type [0 
  - 4] [type of item]</strong><br>
  Sets the type of shop and what items it will sell. You can set values for each, 
  five total.<br>
  Example: Shop type 0 weapon<br>
  Item types that can be used: Light, Scroll, Wand, Staff, Weapon, Treasure, Armor, 
  Potion, Clothing, Furniture, Container, Drinkcontainer, Boat, Pill, Map, Portal, 
  Warpstone, Gem, Jewelry</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3) Shop Hours [open 
  hour] [close hour]</strong><br>
  Sets the times the shop opens and closes. 0 to 23 is a 24 hour shop, use military/24 
  hour clock in calculating times.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>4) Shop Profit [% 
  of value for character buying] [% of value for character selling]</strong><br>
  The first % value is the markup for the mob selling the item to the character, 
  modified by haggle skill. Thus, an item valued at 100 silver, with the number 
  set at 150, will cost the purchaser 150 silver to buy. A lower value, such as 
  75, make the cost 75% of that value.<br>
  </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second % value 
  is the markdown the shop takes for a character trying to sell the mobile an 
  item, modified by the haggle skill. Generally set to lower than 100, to reflect 
  the shop haggling down the cost to the shop's purchasing benefit. An item valued 
  at 100, with a markdwon of 75%, will be sold for just 75 silver.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Resetting shopkeeper 
  and goods</u></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Resets are needed for both 
  the mob shopkeeper in the room, and the objects he or she will sell. This can 
  be accomplished by doing the following:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the room where the shop is to 
  be, the first reset will be the shopkeeper mobile.<br>
  &quot;reset 1 mob (vnum) 1 1&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, list objects in subsequent 
  reset order, settled in the inventory of the mobile.<br>
  &quot;reset 2 obj (vnum) none&quot;<br>
  &quot;reset 3 obj (vnum) none&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon repop, the items should 
  appear in the list of items sold, with appropriate price given markup and markdown 
  scores. If the shop hours are not 24 hours, and the purchaser is trying to buy 
  at the wrong time, they will get a polite &quot;Sorry, I'm closed. Come back 
  later.&quot; Wait out the ticks and list if this happens. Other questions and 
  problems can be asked of the area imps or experienced builders.</font></p>
