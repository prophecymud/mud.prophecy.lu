<strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oedit - OLC's Obect 
Editor </font></strong> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Making weapons and armor, keys to 
  unlock doors, or cool-looking pieces of nothing, Oedit is the way to go. The 
  list of commands goes as follows:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>addaffect [location] 
  [number]:</strong><br>
  Adds an affect, such as hit roll or strength or whatnot, to an object. Check 
  with builder imps before adding affects, as having too many may upset equipment 
  balance in the game, which is working on being fixed. Be sure to stick COMPLETELY 
  to the eq points system (<a href="helpeq.htm">help eq</a>). Type &quot;<a href="ohelp.htm#apply">? 
  apply</a>&quot; to view the list of affects.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>addapply affects 
  [type] [number] [spell] [level] [optionall hidden]:</strong><br>
  Adds a permanent affect to a piece of eq. Please remember, as per <a href="equse.htm">help 
  eq_use</a>, no resistances or immunities are allowed. Type &quot;<a href="ohelp.htm#apptype">? 
  apptype</a>&quot; to see what affects can be added.<br>
  Example : &quot;addapply vuln strength -3 weaken 100 hidden&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>condition:</strong><br>
  Useless number, was used for a repair system, which we don't have. Don't use 
  this, please.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>cost [# silver]:</strong><br>
  Sets the cost of the given object for sale and purchase purposes, given in silver.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>oedit create [new vnum]:</strong><br>
  Creates a new object of a new vnum in the area, and places the builder into 
  the object editor mode.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>delaffect [number in affects 
  list under &quot;show&quot;]:</strong><br>
  Deletes an affect on the list. Typing &quot;show&quot;, look toward the bottom 
  for the affects list. The list number will be on the far left.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ed:</strong><br>
  Extra description editor. Very useful for adding pictures or descriptions of 
  items that would take up too much space in the regular room description. Click 
  <a href="edesc.htm">here</a> to see more information on extra descriptions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>extra [flags]:</strong><br>
  Sets extra flags for the object, such as glow, anti-good, whatnot. Type &quot;<a href="ohelp.htm#extra">? 
  extra</a>&quot; for a list of flags that can be used.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>level [number]:</strong><br>
  Sets the level of the object, with a 30-level difference (thus a level 90 object 
  can be worn by a level 60).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>long [string]:</strong><br>
  Sets the long name for the object, what the player sees when they come into 
  a room and see the object on the ground. Example: &quot;A long blade is here, 
  waiting for its owner.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>material [word_or_words]:</strong><br>
  Sets a material word for an object. If more than one word, use the underscore 
  (_) key to connect the words, instead of the space bar, as words separated by 
  a regular space will zork the mud out, and either crash it or hang it up.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>name [name key words]:</strong><br>
  Sets the basic, operable name of the object, using one or several key words 
  that the character would type to get or use it. Things like &quot;two handed 
  sword&quot; or &quot;ring steel&quot; are appropriate. Keep it to 3 words or 
  less, if possible.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>short [short string]:</strong><br>
  Sets the short description, what the character sees when they're wearing it 
  or picking it up, such as &quot;a high guard sword&quot;. Keep it simple and 
  short. Do not use capitals or full stops.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>show:</strong><br>
  Shows the oedit stats for the object. This command can also be done by pressing 
  the &lt;enter&gt; key on a blank line in the editor.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>type [type]:</strong><br>
  Sets object type. Weapon, armor, jewelry, trash. &quot;? type&quot; gives a 
  list of possible types. One type per object please.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>v0 through v4:</strong><br>
  Sets V values for the types, based on the type of object. Typing v# will show 
  you a list of ? files you can use, and what each v value can do for that particular 
  object.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>wear [flags]:</strong><br>
  Sets wear location of an object. If you want it to be worn in the first place, 
  make sure you set the first wear flag to &quot;take&quot;, so they can pick 
  it up. &quot;<a href="ohelp.htm#wear">? wear</a>&quot; will give you a list 
  of locations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>weight [number]:</strong><br>
  The weight of the object, multiplied by 1/10 in pounds. Thus, an object with 
  weight set to 20 would only weigh 2 pounds in the game. Be reasonable, everything 
  has its weight, don't set it to 0.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>?:</strong><br>
  Lists in-context help files for OLC that can be seen by the builder.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>version: </strong><br>
