Notes On Append Mode
--------------------
For room, mob, or extra descriptions, a text editor known as
"Append mode" is used when you type "desc" (redit or medit)
or "ed add"/"ed edit" (redit or oedit).

There will be a prompt saying "Entering append mode, type .h
on a blank line for help, terminate with a ~ or a @ on a blank
line", then a few lines under that, a ">" Prompt.  Whatever you
type after that > will be entered as part of that description,
so watch what you're typing :)  Type it line for line, as every
time you hit the enter key, it will sotre the line you just typed
and get ready for a new line to be input.

commands (listed when you type ".h" on a clean line)
--------
.f  --> formats the lines to word wrapping, making the desc
        look like an even block paragraph rather than a jumble of 
        cut off lines.

.s  --> shows what you've typed so far, in case you forget.

.c  --> clears the ENTIRE desc, to start over again.

.r "old string" "new string"  --> replaces the old string
           with the new string,  Be sure to include the "" marks.

This is quite useful.  First, type your desc in regular white
coloring.  Then, if you want to add color, .r "plain word" "word
with color code".  The reason for this is the fact that the color code
characters are factored as part of the word wrap, so it makes the 
paragraph look ill-formatted if you add color first.

Example: > Red roses are here.
         > .f
         > .r "Red roses" "`1Red`` roses"


.h  --> lists the commands and their uses.

@ (after typing enter to get a blank line) --> save what you've
typed and exit append mode.
