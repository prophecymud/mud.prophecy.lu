Builder Port Rules for Prophecy:

1) No loading equipment outside of your area; this is to keep people on the builder's
   port from gaining an unfair advantage over their fellow players on the live port,
   by having access to commands and ability to learn the statistics of an area.

2) Before using goto to get into someone else's area, please be sure they have either
   opened it for other builders to look at (just because the area's imped doesn't mean
   it's open), or you have their express permission.  Areas are supposed to be a surprise
   for all to discover, and knowing the secrets beforehand would be considered gaining
   an unfair advantage over other players who do not build.

3) If you have any questions, please email builder@prophecy.lu, write a note to Ctuchik
   and Mordja on the live port, or note to all on the builder's port.  We will work out
   any problems you might have and answer your questions as quickly as possible.

4) Keep working.  Don't let an area sit idle, while the area imps see you on the live port
   consistently.  The faster you finish your area, the faster you get done, the less the
   imps get on your back for not working.  Idle areas are removed, and their builders then
   are removed from the builder port.

5) Occasional calls from one of the area imps on the live port will come, asking for builders
   to check in.  This will usually include your builder character name, what area you are now
   working on, and how much you have left, as well as anticipated time to finish it.  If you
   know someone who is a builder, spread the news to them, and if they aren't able to log on,
   please pass the info on to us.

6) Have fun building.  It's a long task, sometimes boring, sometimes writer's block, but work
   it out and get through it.  The full rewards will be that much more when you see your handi-
   work on the live mud, with players exploring it and looking to you to tell them the secrets.
