<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Prophecy OLC Guide</H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This is a simple page devoted to the commands and structure
of OLC building for Prophecy MUD.  The links at the side of the page are
to text files on the related OLC topic.  Builders, feel free to print them
out for your reference.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Questions can always be noted on the builder's port, or catch
one of the area masters on the live port.  You may also email us at <A
HREF="mailto:builder@prophecy.lu">this link</A>
if you wish to become a builder or can't get a hold of us on either port. </P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Let us all use this as a tool to build quality, challenging
areas that players will enjoy.  Good luck, and let's finish those areas! </P>
