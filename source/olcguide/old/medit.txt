Medit - OLC's Mobile Editor
---------------------------

Challenging mobiles fill an area with life and population, giving it characters of
its own for players to interact with, or kill.  Medit commands are accessed by typing
"medit [existing mob vnum in area]" or "medit create [new mobile vnum in area]"
Commands are as follows:

alignment [number]:
	Sets the alignment of the mobile, from pure evil (-1000) to angelic (1000)
	Keep in mind that low level mobiles should lean more toward neutral than some
	higher level mobs, to keep people from radically changing their align just
	on the basis of their kills.

commands:
	Lists the commands for Medit.

medit create [new vnum]:
	Using a new vnum, the Medit editor creates a new mobile, placing the builder
	into Medit mode for that mobile.

desc:
	Places the builder into the Text Append mode, like room descriptions, except that
	this is to set the mobile's description, what the player sees when they type "look
	[mobile]".  Same editor commands as for the redit append mode.

level [number]:
	Sets the level of the mobile.  Please keep in a 1 to 100 range, and keep in mind the
	level range your area is for.

long [string]:
	Sets the long description of the mobile, what the players will see when they walk into
	a room with the mobile already in it.  Examples: "A city guard protects his post." or
	other such brief, appropriate messages.

name [key words]:
	Sets the key word names for the mobile, the words that a character would type to get a 
	response from the mobile.  Examples are "city guard" or "healer".  Keep it to 3 words,
	if you can help it, less.

short [string]:
	Sets a short string, that a player sees while fighting, or talking to a mobile.
	Examples are "A Guard" or "The healer"

show:
	Shows medit stats of the mobile.  This same command can also be accomplished by just
	hitting <enter> on a blank line.

spec spec_[special function name]:
	Sets a pre-coded special function for the mobile, such as spec_alorn_guard
	or spec_angarak_guard.  For a list of special functions, type "? spec".

sex [male/female/neutral/random]:
	Sets the gender of the mobile.  Male/Female/Neutral are self-explanatory.
	Random sets the gender randomly upon mob repop in the area.

act [flags]:
	Sets the basic action types for the mobile, a fixed default being "NPC".
	Things such as aggressive, cleric, or scavenger are under act.  Type "? act" for
	a listing of possible actions.

affect [flags]:
	Sets what the mobile is affected by, such as haste, flying, or blind.  Type 
	"? affect" to see a list of possible affect spells that the mobile can use.

armor [#pierce #bash #slash #exotic]:
	Sets the armor class of the mobile.  There is a mobile level and stats chart
	for Prophecy, on Mandorallen's page.  Compare to that chart, (multiply by 10,
	if the case calls for it, as the old Diku code was still considered then).
	Example: "Armor -100 -100 -100 -75" sets the 4 armor types to those values
	on that mobile.

form [flags]:
	Sets the form of the mobile, such as sentient (capable of thought) or biped.
	For a list of flags, type "? form".

part [flags]:
	Sets the parts of the mobile, such as arms, legs, guts, head, whatnot.
	"? part" will give you a list of parts that you can use.

imm/res/vuln [flags]:
	Sets the immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities of the mobs.  Please
	don't set too many immunities or resistances without balancing a few vulnerabilities
	in with it to balance it out.  Mobs will be tested.

material [word]:
	Sets the material for the mob, such as flesh, skin_and_bones, rock, whatnot.
	When using multiple words, DO NOT PUT SPACES BETWEEN THE WORDS.  Instead, use
	the underscore (_) key to connect the words, as spaces in the material zork the
	mud and cause it to hang up or crash.

off [flags]: 
	Sets offensive flags, such as area_attack, that the mobile uses in a fight.
	Type "? off" for a list of useable flags.

size [size flags]:
	Sets the size of the mobile, affecting how well it fights against a character,
	allowing it certain bonuses.  Tiny would be a mouse, small for birds, medium for human,
	large, huge, and giant, for anything else on that sort of scale. Only one size may be set,
	so see "? size " for the listing of sizes you can use.

hitdice [#d#+bonus]: 
	Sets the hitpoints of the mob, based on a roll of a specific number of x-sided dice.
	See Mandorallen's mobile level chart to get a general idea of the range your mobile should
	be in for hitdice.

manadice [#d#+bonus]:
	For spellcasting mobs, sets the mana that they have.

damdice [#d#bonus]:
	Sets the damage that the mobile can do, based on a dice roll with added bonus.
	Check Mandorallen's chart for an idea of what you should have, don't make a level 1 mob that
	can deal 1000 damage a hit.  

damtype [damnoun]:
	Sets the default damage noun of the mobile, if it isn't wielding a weapon.
	See "? weapon" for a list of nouns and the names you can use to set them.

race [race]:
	Looking at "race ?" under OLC help, (race ?, not ? race), you can set the race of the mobile,
	and thus effectively cut down on manually setting parts and certain affects.  Old Diku races,
	as well as Prophecy's human races, are all listed in "race ?".

position start [position]
position default [position]:
	Sitting, resting, standing, or sleeping, the four standard positions.  The start position
	is how the mobile will be when it repops, and the default is the position it will return to
	after a fight.

wealth [number in SILVER]:
	Sets the amount of money the mobile is carrying, in silver.  If you want the mob to carry
	a little bit of gold, remember the exchange rate is 100 silver per gold, but the editor
	will mix it up some, so you could have 20 gold and 4000 silver upon autogolding a mob.

hitroll [number]:
	Sets a hitroll bonus for the mob.  Keep to a modest amount, so that players might have an
	equal chance at hitting the mob as it has at them.

group [group number]:
	Set with other mobiles of a different type, this sets a group number that the mobile belongs
	to for purposes of assisting his fellows.

addmprog [vnum of mprog] [trigger] [%]
	Sets an mprog with given vnum, to the trigger at % of the time.  Such as:
	"Addmprog 250 grall 100" will set mprog 250 to the mob, greeting all who
	come in 100% of the time.

delmprog [number on list]:
	Removes an mprog from the list.  First, type "show" or hit <enter> on a blank line,
	and look at the far left column for the mprog number on the list, starting with 0 and going
	up in 1 number increments as mprogs are added.

?:
	Lists the types of in-context OLC help files one may view.

version: 
	Shows the credits and current version of our OLC editor.
