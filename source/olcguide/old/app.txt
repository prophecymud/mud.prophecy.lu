           INTERESTED IN BECOMING A BUILDER FOR PROPHECY?

Look no further than right here for the process by which we recruit
and train new builders.  Please take note of the following:

- on the live port, write a note to 'Ctuchik Mordja Builder', with the
  subject line "Builder Application".  In this note, please give the
  following information:

   -Your character name
   -Email address, and any other allowable contact information
   -How long have you been playing Prophecy?
   -How long have you been playing MUDs in General?
   -Have you built using OLC before? (If not, no problem)
   -If so, how much experience, and where?
   -How familiar are you with the Belgariad and Malloreon books?
   -What is your motivation for building for Prophecy?
   -What areas would you be interested in adding to our world?
   -Any other information you think we might need to know.

  You will receive a return note within several days.  If not, please write a
  brief note saying you put in your application without response, and we will
  personally see to it that you are spoken with.

  After we respond to your note, we will set your character up on the builder's
  port, to include commands, OLC security, and a spot with the OLC school.  At
  the OLC School, you will build up to three rooms, one mobile, and  two to three
  objects of varying types, to teach and test your skills.  After OLC school, we
  will ask you what area you would like to try to build.  There will be a wide 
  variety to choose from, as we are trying to fill the MUD world with original,
  Eddings-based areas.
