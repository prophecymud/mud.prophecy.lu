Resets in OLC
-------------
Resetting mobs, or objects in rooms in OLC isn't all that difficult.
If you want to see how to make shops, see the section on shops.  This section
deals with just loading a mob into a room as a reset, or placing an object
in a room/in a room on a mob/in a room in another container.

The easiest way to reset mobs is to go to the room you want the mob to
originate from.  Then type "redit".

"mreset (vnum of mob) (global limit) (room limit)"
mreset=Mob Reset. 
vnum of mob is self-explanatory.
Global limit is the total number of mobs in the world.
Room limit is the total number of mobs to be reset in that room.

The other way is to do this:
In the room, outside of redit:
"reset # mob (vnum of mob) (global limit) (room limit)"
where the # is the reset number on the list, when you type "resets" in the
room.


Object resets are a little more difficult, because of more possibilities
with where and how to put an object.

"oreset (vnum of object)" will reset an object with specified vnum on the 
ground in that room.

"oreset (vnum of object) inside (name of container in room)"
resets that object inside a container already in the room.
If you want more than one, just repeat the resets.

"oreset (vnum of object) (keyword of mob) (wear location)"
resets an object on the mob that is also reset to the room, 
on the specified wear location.  Type "? wear-loc" to see where
you can put the object on the mob.
