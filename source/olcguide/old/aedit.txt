Aedit - Area Edit
-----------------

Useful in the overall management of areas by the implementors on the builder's
port, and also useful in editing time and weather customs by the builder to tailor
his or her area.  Below are the commands used by the Area Editor under OLC.

age:
	The age of the area, in weeks.  This number is not to be altered in any form, 
	please do not use this command.

builder [name]:
	Sets up the named person for building the area, regardless of OLC security.
	If more than one person is building the area, names have to be done one at 
	a time.

commands:
	shows a list of possible commands under Aedit.

aedit create [vnum]:
	For builder port implementors only.  This command is used after consulting 
	"alist" to find the last vnum used for an area, found in the far left side
	of the columns.  This command can be used outside of the Aedit editor, and
	will also put the user into the Aedit editor upon creation of the area.

filename ../area/[area].are:
	For builder port implementors only.  This command sets a filename for the
	parea account folder that stores area files.

name [Name of Area]:
	Sets up a regular name for the area, such as Sendar or Algarian Plains.

reset:
	resets the area, so mobs and objects may repop.  

security 9:
	Sets OLC security for the area, so that only the area imps and the builders
	set for the area may edit the area as necessary.  To be used by area imps 
	only.

show:
	Shows the Aedit stats for the area.  By hitting the enter key on a blank
	line in aedit, it does the same thing as the "sho" command.

vnum [lower vnum] [upper vnum]:
	In one command, sets the uppoer and lower vnum range for the area.
	For area imps only.  Check against other areas to make
	sure vnums don't overlap.

lvnum [lower vnum #]:
	Resets the lower vnum for the range of the area.

uvnum [upper vnum #]:
	Resets the upper vnum for the range of the area.

credits {level_range} Builder_name Area_name:
	Sets up the credits, which players will see when they type "areas" on the
	mud.  It will look something like "{10 25} Joe Joe's Diner"

?:
	Shows the listing of in-context OLC helpfiles available.

version:
	Gives the version and credits for our version of OLC.


Customs (For All Builders):
Customs add a flavor to the area, setting it away from the usual "The Day has begun."
There are two sets of customs, Time and Weather.

Time customs:
-------------
There are four time customs, reflecting the start of the day, sunrise, sunset, and darkness.
When in Aedit, just type "time [type] [string you want to use for that time]"

Time types: daybreak sunrise sunset dark
Example: "time sunrise The sun rises in the east."


Weather Customs:
----------------
There are six weather customs, reflecting things such as rain, lightning, or the stoppage
of such.  When in Aedit, just type "weather [type][string you want to use for that kind of
weather]"

Weather types: clear cloudy rain stoprain lightning stoplightning
Example: "weather clear The clouds roll away, revealing clear skies."
