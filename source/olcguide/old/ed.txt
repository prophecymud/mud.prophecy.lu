Extra Description Editors

Used in REdit and OEdit, extra descriptions allow the builder to add to normal descriptions that would
otherwise be too long.  Things like what a picture looks like in the room, or an inscription in a ring,
can be shown using an Extra Description.  To access this function, make sure redit or oedit mode, and a
default vnum object or room given, is on.  Then, type one of the following 3 commands:

"Ed add (keyword)"
This will add a keyword to the extra description list, The keyword is the word the character will type
when they type "look" to see what's on the ring or in the room.  Typing this command will also put the
user into the text append mode, similar to rdesc for hostels and also room description building on the
builder's port.  

"Ed Edit (keyword)"
Used on existing keywords, this command allows the builder to edit the extra description, provided that
the ED is already a part of the room or object.  This will also put the builder into the text append
mode.

"Ed delete (keyword)"
Removes the keyword from the object, its extra description also goes with it.
