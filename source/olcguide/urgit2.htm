<font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&quot;The Butcher, 
the Baker and the... other one&quot;: Shops in MUDs </strong> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Urgit writes about the 
  variety of shops available.</em></font> <font size="2"><em>A list of shops at 
  the <a href="#list">bottom</a> may be helpful for builders.</em></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Good shops can really add value to an area. Yet too many Builders 
  on most MUDs waste this opportunity to make their area unique and distinctive. 
  They throw in a butcher, a baker, a weapons shop, an armour shop, a tavern and 
  call it done. Many areas don't even need shops- have you ever seen a baker with 
  a stall in a maze of underground caverns? - but people add them anyway. However, 
  the worse case is where an area had the space and potential for several interesting 
  shops, yet the Builder chose to stick to those that are in every other similar 
  area in every other MUD.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">People want their areas to be noticeable, to be visited, to 
  be remembered. An imaginative approach to shops is one of many ways to help 
  achieve that.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">- Some areas will have more than one of some types of shop. 
  A Cherek town will probably have far more than a single tavern, for example.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> - Related shops. Those Cherek taverns don't exist is a vacuum. 
  The beer may come from different brewes, who themselves will get ingredients 
  from farmers and others. The barrels must be supplied by someone, and so on.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> - If a nation has a specialty, it's likely there'll be more 
  than one of that particular shop in the settlement. A Nadrak town will likely 
  have more than one tanner. In Tolnedra, where commerce is so rampant and both 
  class and competition strong forces, there may be a few of any type of shop. 
  If there's a bakery, there might well be another merchant posing as a &quot;High 
  Class Baker&quot;, with items named and priced accordingly. If merchants are 
  competing, think about how they might try to attract people to buy their own 
  wares.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> - Don't be afraid of having mobs selling useless items, or 
  mixing up useful things with less worthwhile ones. More items available in shops 
  helps add character and<br>
  texture to the area.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> - Items bought in shops might not be finished products, but 
  able to be turned into something useful elsewhere in the area. A shopkeepers 
  might sell damaged armour for low prices that wouldn't be any real use, but 
  perhaps another mob in the area, give suitable progs, could be able to turn 
  those items into something possible to<br>
  wear. While this type of thing probably wouldn't constitute a miniquest, allowing 
  you to make the equipment stronger than the points system usually allows, it 
  adds<br>
  texture.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> - However, shops can be made a part of good miniquests. For 
  example, you might be rewarded for handing a letter to a Tolnedran nobleman 
  in the middle of a party. However, the party dress code is typically strict, 
  and you need to collect and wear certain items to be admitted. Several items 
  can be bought from shops in the city, but one isn't. Yet you can buy the raw 
  materials from a clothmaker and a haberdasher, and then give them to a mob with 
  suitable progs who will create the required item. So many miniquests can be 
  created in which shops can play an active and useful part.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> - There are lots of different types of shops that can be included 
  in areas. As a final thought, and to get the imagination started, here's a short
