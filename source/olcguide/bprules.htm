      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">The Builder Port is a very powerful tool granted 
        to mortals deemed worthy<br>
        of its power. As such, when a builder cannot be trusted, they lose their<br>
        builder status. The rules on BP are for the most part the same as on live,<br>
        with a few notable exceptions:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Fixedsys"><font color="#00FFFF">- </font></font><font color="#CCCCCC">Aggressive 
        Actions/PK Rules:<br>
        These do not apply in part or in whole to BP.<br>
        <font color="#00FFFF">-</font> Swearing<br>
        You will not be punished for swearing. However, out of courtesy, keep 
        it down.<br>
        <font color="#00FFFF">-</font> Multiplaying<br>
        Due to the fact that builders are 93 and above, we encourage area testing 
        with<br>
        level 1-91 mortal chars. <font color="#FFFF00">Remember: you are an immortal 
        on BP, thus you can<br>
        do things you CAN'T do on live.</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Rules not found on Live that apply to BP:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#00FFFF">-</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> &quot;Horseplay&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">BP is a place to work and create new areas for 
        live. It is <font color="#FFFF00">NOT</font> a chatroom,<br>
        a place to test PK skills, or anything which doesn't involve building 
        an area.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#00FFFF">-</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Privacy (Non-Imped 
        areas)</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Consider every builder's area to be their home. 
        You must ask before entering,<br>
        and leave when they log off. Under no circumstances are you ever to explore<br>
        an area under construction.<font color="#FFFF00"> Failure to comply may 
        result in deletion from BP.</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#00FFFF">-</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Implemented Areas/Immortal 
        commands</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">This is the golden rule of BP. Never are you allowed 
        to explore an area on BP,<br>
        stat eq, or stat mobs for the purpose of gaining knowledge for use on 
        live. You<br>
        MAY, as a builder however, check mobs, eq, and mprogs for knowledge to 
        enhance<br>
        your own area. We, the BP Staff, will know the difference. Use common 
        sense<br>
        or you'll find out very quickly how much you can be punished for disobeying 
        <br>
        this rule. <font color="#FFFF00">Failure to comply can and will result 
        in deletion on BP AND live.</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">As always, you are responsibile for knowing the 
        rules of BP. Ignorance is <br>
        never an excuse. We've trusted you with the commands and access you have. 
        <br>
        Don't screw up.<br>
