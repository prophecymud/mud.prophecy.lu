  Prophecy OLC Guide</font></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This page is dedicated to the commands 
  and structure of OLC Building for Prophecy MUD, part of an ongoing effort to 
  provide support and encouragement to our Building Staff in producing quality 
  areas that improve and enhance our world. While some of the files are tailored 
  to the theme and Building structure on Prophecy, we hope it might also provide 
  some valuable assistance to Builders elsewhere in the MUD community.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The links at the side of 
  the page are to files on the related OLC topics. Most detail the commands within 
  OLC used to construct an area, but there are also details on Builder application, 
  <a href="rules.htm">rules and guidelines</a> for building on Prophecy, and other 
  pieces of useful information for a Builder.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  An <a href="walk.htm">OLC walkthrough</a> was recently added by Salmissra that 
  provides a detailed step-by-step guide to further aid the new Builder to settle 
  into the task. Technical OLC instructions, style and strategy guides are being 
  contributed by experienced Builders that may well be useful as inspiration and 
  a further reference source.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Feel free to print the pages 
  of this guide for reference. Questions about this guide, problems in Building 
  or suggestions for improvement can be noted to the <a href="staff.htm" target="_blank">Area 
  Staff</a> on the Builders' or Live Ports, or you can catch one of us online. 
  Builder Applications from enthusiastic new and experienced Builders alike are 
  always welcome and will be considered promptly. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hope this guide will continue to 
  be of use to Builders throughout the MUD community, and that with this reference 
  source, and the continuing area code updates we can continue to produce high 
  quality, original, challenging areas for the players of Prophecy to enjoy.</font></p>
