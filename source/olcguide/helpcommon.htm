<p><strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Common sense</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Area-Edit<br>
  * Be mindful when changing the weather/time customs. Try to make them as neutral 
  as possible, i.e. don't mention the sun is coming out after the rain since it 
  might be in the middle of the night. The sun is rarely seen during the night. 
  Go into Aedit and asave area now and then. You never know when it might crash. 
  </font> </p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mobile-Edit<br>
  * Do not add shopkeepers to a group as they might then autoassist other mobiles 
  and make things screwy. Do not give them too much wealth and try to make the 
  long description as neutral as possible if they are not sentinels. Do not try 
  to &quot;force&quot; RP in the mobiles description (saying the player gets scared 
  by looking at him/her etcetera).<br>
  <br>
  Mobprog-Edit<br>
  * Not much to mention here. If you run into problems check www.mud.lu or ask 
  a fellow builder. Just keep in mind that no one knows everything.<br>
  <br>
  Object-Edit<br>
  * Always try and set a level on items you can pick up, use only English words 
  in the name file and try to use realistic material and weight. Try to make the 
  long description as neutral as possible.<br>
  <br>
  Room-Edit<br>
  * Try to make 200/200 healing rooms rather rare, add appropriate sector/room 
  flags and try not to &quot;force&quot; RP in the room's description (telling 
  the player which way they are heading, how the feel, what the weather is like 
  etcetera).<br>
  <br>
  Mini-quests<br>
  * Try to make Mini-quests doable by the people it is intended for. If the reward 
  is a level 1 item you should not have to be level 40 to do the quest. On the 
  final reward for the mini-quest (if it is a takeable item) please add the words 
  &quot;MQ&quot; or &quot;Mini-quest&quot; or such in the name so we do not have 
  to examine every mprog and mob twice to determine if it is a mini-quest item, 
  and let the Area Immortals know if you do not want that mini-quest part to remain 
  in the item's name. Or send a note to the Area Immortals saying which items 
  are mini-quest items.<br>
  <br>
  General<br>
  * Try not to mix mini-quests and rareloads or, if you feel you want/have to, 
  only add the extra points from either the mini-quest or the rareload, not both.</font></p>
