<p><font size="2"><a name="redit"></a>Redit is the room editor for OLC on Prophecy. 
  By using the various commands, one can build quality rooms with wonderful descriptions, 
  hidden extras, and doors leading all directions. Below is the list of commands 
  and their uses when using Redit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>commands:</strong><br>
  Lists commands that the builder may use in Redit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>redit create [new vnum in area]:</strong><br>
  Creates a new vnum for a room, transfers the builder into that room, and also 
  places the builder in Redit mode.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>desc:</strong><br>
  Places builder in append mode, similar to the &quot;rdesc&quot; for hostels 
  on the live port. By typing &quot;.h&quot; on a blank line in the description 
  editor, commands for the editor can be seen and used.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>ed: </strong><br>
  Extra description editor. Very useful for adding pictures or descriptions of 
  items that would take up too much space in the regular room description. Click 
  <a href="edesc.htm">here</a> to see more information on extra descriptions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>format:</strong><br>
  Sets the description into a paragraph, word-wrapped to fit the formatting on 
  the mud, so as not to look jumbled up on different clients or telnet.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>name [string]: </strong><br>
  Sets a short string for the name of the room, such as &quot;By the Temple Altar&quot; 
  or &quot;Chapel&quot;. Please keep these brief and free of color for simplicity's 
  sake.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>owner [name]:</strong><br>
  USE SPARINGLY. This sets the named person as the sole owner of the room, flagging 
  it solitary and thus forbidding entrance by anyone other than its owner.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>heal [number]:</strong><br>
  Sets the healing rate of the room, 100 being &quot;normal&quot;. Do not set 
  over 200, or less than 0. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>mana [number]:</strong><br>
  Sets the mana refresh rate of the room, 100 being &quot;normal&quot;. Do not 
  set over 100, or less than 0.</font></p>
<p><strong><font size="2">[room type]:<br>
  </font></strong><font size="2">Sets the room type, which will have different 
  affects on the player. Do not add &quot;room&quot; before the flag. Type &quot;<a href="rhelp.htm#room">? 
  room</a>&quot; for the list of flags.</font></p>
<p><strong><font size="2">[sector type]:<br>
  </font></strong><font size="2">Sets the sector for the room, which will determine 
  how much movement is used to move into the room and whether fly/boats are required. 
  Do not add &quot;sector&quot; before the flag. Type &quot;<a href="rhelp.htm#sector">? 
  sector</a>&quot; to view the list of sectors.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>?:</strong><br>
  Lists in-context help topics for OLC.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong>version: </strong><br>
  Shows our version of OLC, and the people who helped make it what it is.</font></p>
<p><strong><font size="2"><u><a name="reset"></a>Resetting mobs and objects in 
  redit:</u></font></strong></p>
</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>mreset [mob vnum] 
  [room max] [global max]:</strong><br>
  Resets a mob of the given vnum to the room, with the room max being the max 
  number of mobs possible to be in that room at one time, and the global max setting 
  the highest number of the mobile that can be present on the mud at any given 
  time. Be careful not to mix these up, or there will be a lot of mobs wandering 
  around your area.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>oreset [obj vnum]<br>
  oreset [obj vnum] [wear_location on mobile]<br>
  oreset [obj vnum] inside [name of container already reset]:</strong><br>
  Resets objects for the room. The first is to reset an object to the floor in 
  the room, the second is to equip mobiles, as long as the mobile has already 
  been reset to the room, while the third resets the object into a container that 
  has also already been reset to the room first.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>mlist OR olist [name 
  or vnum of mob/object]:</strong><br>
  Lists objects or mobs based on name keywords, or their vnums, in that area.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>mshow OR oshow [name 
  or vnum of mob/object]:</strong><br>
  Shows medit/oedit show stats for the given mobile or object name, in that area.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u><a name="exits"></a>Exits:</u></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whether it be doors leading 
  back and forth, or making a maze to challenge players, exits are the mainstay 
  of an area, the links to the other rooms and the doors that keep people from 
  going through.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A basic command syntax can 
  be found in &quot;help olcexit&quot;, and is explained in detail here.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>[direction] dig 
  [new vnum]:</strong><br>
  Using a north/south/east/west/up/down for your [direction], you are both creating 
  a new room (so use an unused vnum in your area), and creating a two-way, open 
  link between the two rooms. To edit the room you just created, you will have 
  to walk in that direction into the new room.</font></p>
<p><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[direction] link 
  [existing vnum]:</font></strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Creates a two-way, open link between the room you're standing in and an existing 
  room elsewhere. Be careful, and check to make sure the other room doesn't already 
  have an exit on the arriving side (so if you are &quot;east link 2&quot;, make 
  sure room 2 doesn't already have a path leading west).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>[direction] room 
  [existing vnum]:</strong><br>
  Used with caution, this creates a ONE-WAY exit from the room you are standing 
  in to an existing room. By one-way, it means that you can go to that room you 
  just linked to, but cannot come back in the opposite direction. Good for small 
  mazes, but don't get lost trying to do it, either.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>[direction] [flag]:</strong><br>
  After an existing link has been made, flags can be added to the link. For example, 
  &#8220;east door&#8221; creates a door, and &#8220;east locked&#8221; will make 
  the door locked by default. The flags are toggles, so you can toggle it on or 
  off.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>[direction] key 
  [object vnum]:</strong><br>
  Sets an EXISTING object, that should be of the type &quot;key&quot;, as the 
  key that can unlock this door. Mandatory and set after you create, close, and 
  lock a door.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>[direction] delete:</strong><br>
  Removes the link from the room you're standing in to the room in that direction. 
  Good if you messed up, or don't want the link to go there.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>? EXIT flags:</strong><br>
  door: create a door in desired direction.<br>
  *closed: closes the door in that direction.<br>
  *locked: locks a closed door in that direction. Remember to create a key if 
  necessary.<br>
  *pickproof: thieves cannot pick open the door.<br>
  *nopass: people with pass_door cannot go through.<br>
  *easy/hard/infuriating: how difficult it is to pick open the lock<br>
  *noclose: sets the door as uncloseable by the player, once opened<br>
  *nolock: sets the door to where it cannot be locked by the player.<br>
  hidden: when a door is NOT present in that direction, this will take the link 
  direction off of a players &quot;autoexit&quot;, forcing them to go where they 
  think they cannot go. Useful for hidden rooms for people to discover. Setting 
  a door to hidden will cause the port to crash.<br>
  window: when a door is NOT present in that direction, this will create a window. 
  Players can look through the window to see the linked room, and archers can 
  shoot through the window at their target in the room. However, the exit itself 
  is small, so players cannot pass through it.</font></p>
