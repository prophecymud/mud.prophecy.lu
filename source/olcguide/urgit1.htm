<font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Approaching An Area 
</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
<p><font size="2"><em>Urgit gives some thoughts on organising building an area.</em></font></p>
<p><font size="2">So, you've sent in your Builder Application, been approved and 
  set up on the Builders' Port, and, if you're new to Building, got some practice 
  creating a few bits pieces in a test area. Now you're ready to start on an area 
  of your own. At this point, while it's exciting, the task ahead can seem frightening. 
  What should I do first? What order should I do things in? How do I turn the 
  ideas I have into a quality complete area?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">While there are infinite ways in which you can approach an area, 
  and lots of great areas have been produced for Prophecy using different methods, 
  I thought I'd outline an order of proceeding and some tips that have worked 
  for me, ideas that I hope would help new builders to split up the task into 
  manageable sections, allow you to work steadily towards a great area and avoid 
  wasting time and effort. I'm not suggesting this is a complete or foolproof 
  blueprint, but I hope it might be a decent starting point to finding your own 
  ideal strategy. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 1. <u>Choosing an Area</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">It might seem an obvious step that requires little thought, 
  but you can help yourself by picking a suitable area.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The type of area you pick will be affected by how big you want 
  to it to be. Cities and vast geographical features really requires a large area 
  to do them justice. What you pick may also be affected by what books you're 
  read (having read about an area is an advantage) or the type of area you'd enjoy 
  building (some people prefer wilderness areas, while many others prefer to portray 
  the confines of civilization).</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Don't pick something too big if you're new to building. It's 
  much better to complete a small, neat area than to get swamped by the prospect 
  of a huge one and get discouraged and give up. Once you have everything practiced 
  and you know what your strengths are, there's always the possibility of then 
  building something more ambitious. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 2. <u>Research</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">It's too easy to just jump into building at this stage, where 
  a little preparation would save time and problems later on. If you were going 
  to build a house, you'd sit down and think through what you want and what makes 
  a good home, and make some plans, rather than grab the bricks and cement as 
  soon as you've found a plot.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">There are many ways in which you can research and prepare:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">a) Take a look at suitable parts in the books. If you've read 
  them, it's worth looking over parts where your area or similar areas are mentioned. 
  There may be descriptions you can use as inspiration for your own descriptions 
  later on. Even if your own area is not specifically described, appropriately 
  similar areas probably are. If you're building a Tolnedran city, for example, 
  read through the descriptions of Tol Honeth and it's people.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">b) Ask people. If you've not read the books, others may be able 
  to help you locate suitable passages for you to read, or give you some idea 
  what the people of a particular nation are like. The members of the Role Playing 
  Council (RPC) would be glad to help in this regard, since it helps us create 
  more areas that are consistent with the works of Eddings. Other Builders who 
  have built similar areas may also be able to give advice, for example.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">c) Search the Web. There are several Eddings sites that might 
  give you ideas, but more general research is possible too. If you're building 
  a forest, for instance, you may well be able to find a site that will give you 
  ideas for types of tree and features to include, making writing descriptions 
  later on considerably easier. By researching thoroughly you give yourself a 
  much easier time if you have problems with ideas and inspiration later on.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 3. <u>Make a Map</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">While you might think you can visualise in detail what your 
  area will look like, making a map really helps in so many ways. It enables you 
  to get the best layout possible- so after drawing it out once you might think 
  of appropriate additions or changes, for example. You see if you have enough 
  vnums for your plan and thus if you need to ask for a few more. It gives you 
  a reference point that you can turn to at any time in the process of building. 
  It also lets you mark off your progress as you go along, so you know what you've 
  done and what you still have to do. (I always have a hard copy of my map to 
  hand as I'm building, where I can mark things as complete, or take notes of 
  where I want to add features later in the building process. When I'm finished, 
  I'd rather have a messy map than a messy area.)</font></p>
<p><font size="2">There are several free programs that you can download that will 
  create good maps, including these:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">- <a href="http://www.stud.ux.his.no/%7Eaustad/mud/mapmaker/">ASCII 
  Mapmaker</a><br>
  - <a href="http://home.in.tum.de/%7Ekoehlerh/mapmaker/mapmaker.html">MapMaker</a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">However, a lot of people (myself included) choose to draw maps 
  by hand on squared paper. It's mainly about finding a method you're comfortable 
  with and that works well for you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 4. <u>Lay Out Rooms</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Once I have my map, I should know within a little where I want 
  all my rooms and how I want them connected to one another. Some people think 
  it's best to make one or a few rooms, then a mob, then an object, then a few 
  more rooms, etc. That way allows variety, but I strongly believe it's best to 
  do all of one thing first- so complete rooms before going on to mobs, for example. 
  Doing so allows more consistency throughout the area, and often by doing lots 
  of one thing at a time you become quicker and more efficient at it. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">As I dig out the rooms and link them, I tend to mark each room 
  on my map with a dot once each is created, so I can easily see what I've done 
  and still need to do. You can also mark the numbers of key vnums on your map, 
  so you can quickly find and go to them later on. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">It's possible to set room names, room flags and sectors as you 
  go along, or go through after all the rooms are created and do it. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">As I'm laying out rooms, I also start making a list of mobs 
  that I want to create later on. When I've laid out a Guardhouse, I'd note the 
  need for a guard mobile to put in it. Starting such a list now saves me effort 
  later on, when I might have forgotten some of the mobs I intended to include. 
  I might also now start a list of objects I'll need to create later on- so as 
  I make a temple, for example, I'll note that I want to create an altar object 
  to put in it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 5. <u>Write Room Descriptions</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">This part takes some time, especially if you want to write lots 
  of good, interesting, varied, detailed descriptions. Lots of people give up 
  areas at this stage, but it's really worth sticking with it, because once this 
  part is done you're a huge step nearer to completing the area. Some people motivate 
  themselves by setting a target of a few descriptions each day or a certain amount 
  each week. Some find it best to work hard on it for a while and then give themselves 
  a few days off to recharge. Whatever you do, don't give up and thus waste your 
  hard work and ideas. Hopefully, if you did a fair amount of research earlier 
  on you'll have lots of relevant ideas to make the task of writing descriptions 
  easier and faster. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Once I've written a description for a room, I draw a line through 
  it on my map, again so I know what I've done. I might also in writing descriptions 
  think of more ideas to add to my mobile/object lists.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 6. <u>Create Mobiles</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Now we can create all the mobiles our area needs. Hopefully 
  I've built up a good list of ideas while researching and making the rooms, and 
  now I can edit that, add some more to the list and make them, marking them off 
  the list as I do so. While I'm creating mobs, I'll also think of ideas for objects 
  that they might be arrying/using, so I can continue to add them to my list of 
  objects, which will again help me later on. If I create a gardener, I might 
  not down to create a rake for him to carry, for example. All the time we can 
  concentrate on one thing at a time while thinking how what we're doing now affects 
  what we need to do later, making later tasks easier.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 7. <u>Create Objects</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Again, the list we've created should make it easier. A little 
  thought can make my list more complete, and then I can create everything, marking 
  them off on the list as I go.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 8. <u>Add Resets</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Having created all the mobs and objects, we can now create resets 
  for them to load around the area. Reading the resets section of the OLCGuide 
  is a really good idea before starting, as is developing a plan of how to work 
  through them systematically. Some people will do all the resets in one room 
  first, whereas others will create resets for all mobs in order and then all 
  objects. Just ensure you have a plan that will mean you don't forget to add 
  resets where you wanted them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 9. <u>Add Progs</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Good programs can really make an area feel alive. I tend to 
  add progs after I've done all other resets, so I can see all my mobs around 
  the area and see where some action is needed. If I've created a miniquest or 
  two within the area, I'll need progs to make them work. However, it adds a lot 
  of character to an area to extend progs beyond what's absolutely essential for 
  your area to function. It also means that the progs for your miniquests are 
  not immediately obvious, so people have<br>
  to work harder and explore your area more closely to complete them. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 10. <u>Add Finishing Touches</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">It'd be easy to &quot;finish&quot; the area now, but now is 
  also the time you can add more texture and fun parts. It's better to spend some 
  time adding them now than having the area implemented and thinking later how 
  much you wish you'd included them. You might have thought of a few additional 
  mobs, objects or progs to enhance the area. There might be extra descs that 
  you want to add. There are the weather/time updates and credits to think of. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Getting another Builder to explore your area might also help 
  you to identify areas where you could further improve it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> 11. <u>Check Everything</u></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Check through your area thoroughly. Although someone else will 
  check it before it's implemented, it helps a lot for you to go through as well 
  as you can rather than leaving the work to them. Check the spelling in your 
  room descriptions. Make sure your mobiles and equipment meet the requirements 
  of the points systems. Read through your notes and ensure there's nothing you 
  meant to include that you forgot. If your area is for a particular level range, 
  create another character of the <br>
  appropriate level and try the area out yourself. With the Area Immortals' permission, 
  get a friend to help you test and check- they might be able to give you a good 
  impartial view before the area is implemented.</font></p>
</font> 
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm sure people can think 
  of improvements on this, and other tips that may be useful. Feel free to note 
  them to the Immortal Staff so that we can put them up so that others might benefit 
  from them. I just hope that this provides a starting point from which people 
  can make their own strategy and thus succeed in producing great areas that players 
  will find interesting and entertaining, and that thus provide a source of pride 
  for the Builder.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Good luck.</font></p>
