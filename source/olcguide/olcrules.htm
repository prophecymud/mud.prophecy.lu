  rules </strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) No loading equipment outside of 
  your area; this is to keep people on the builder's port from gaining an unfair 
  advantage over their fellow players on the live port, by having access to commands 
  and ability to learn the statistics of an area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Before using goto to get into 
  someone else's area, please be sure they have either opened it for other builders 
  to look at (just because the area's imped doesn't mean it's open), or you have 
  their express permission. Areas are supposed to be a surprise for all to discover, 
  and knowing the secrets beforehand would be considered gaining an unfair advantage 
  over other players who do not build.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) If you have any questions, please 
  email builder@prophecy.lu, write a note to Kail on the live port, note to all 
  on the builder's port or ask someone with a builder flag. We will work out any 
  problems you might have and answer your questions as quickly as possible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) Keep working. Don't let an area 
  sit idle, while the area imps see you on the live port consistently. The faster 
  you finish your area, the faster you get done, the less the imps get on your 
  back for not working. Idle areas are removed, and their builders then are removed 
  from the builder port.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5) Occasional calls from one of the 
  area imps on the live port will come, asking for builders to check in. This 
  will usually include your builder character name, what area you are now working 
  on, and how much you have left, as well as anticipated time to finish it. If 
  you know someone who is a builder, spread the news to them, and if they aren't 
  able to log on, please pass the info on to us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6) Have fun building. It's a long 
  task, sometimes boring, sometimes you may experience writer's block, but work it out and get through 
  it. The full rewards will be that much more when you see your handiwork on the 
  live mud, with players exploring it and looking to you to tell them the secrets.</font></p>
