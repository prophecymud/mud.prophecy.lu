<strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Extra Description Editors 
</font></strong> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Used in Redit and Oedit, 
  extra descriptions allow the builder to add to normal descriptions that would 
  otherwise be too long. Things like what a picture looks like in the room, or 
  an inscription in a ring, can be shown using an extra description. Please note 
  that if there is an object or mob in the room with the same name as the extra 
  description, the object/mob is considered more important and so look [name of 
  extra desc] won&#8217;t work. However, for objects, once you pick up the object, 
  and there are no other items with the same name as the extra desc, players can 
  read the extra description on the object. So for example, if a book has &quot;book&quot; 
  as an extra description, the extra desc can be read once the book is picked 
  up, and nothing else in the room has the name &quot;book&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To access this function, 
  make sure you are in redit or oedit mode and a default vnum object or room given. 
  Then, type one of the following three commands:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ed add (keyword)</strong><br>
  This will add a keyword to the extra description list, The keyword is the word 
  the character will type when they type &quot;look&quot; to see what's on the 
  ring or in the room. Typing this command will also put the user into the text 
  append mode, similar to rdesc for hostels and also room description building 
  on the builder's port. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ed Edit (keyword)</strong><br>
  Used on existing keywords, this command allows the builder to edit the extra 
  description, provided that the ED is already a part of the room or object. This 
  will also put the builder into the text append mode.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ed delete (keyword)</strong><br>
  Removes the keyword and extra description from the object.</font></p>
