<div align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Interested 
  in becoming a builder?</strong></font></div>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Look no further than right 
  here for the process by which we recruit and train new builders. Please take 
  note of the following:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- on the live port, write 
  a note to 'Kail Urgit Builder', with the subject line &quot;Builder Application&quot;. 
  In this note, please give the following information:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - Your character name<br>
    - Email address, and any other (optional) contact information you may wish to provide<br>
    - How long have you been playing Prophecy?<br>
    - How long have you been playing MUDs in General?<br>
    - Have you built using OLC before? (If not, no problem)<br>
    - If so, how much experience, and where?<br>
    - How familiar are you with the Belgariad and Malloreon books?<br>
    - What is your motivation for building for Prophecy?<br>
    - What areas would you be interested in adding to our world?<br>
    - Any other information you think we might need to know.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You will receive a return 
  note within several days. If not, please write a brief note saying you put in 
  your application without response, and we will personally see to it that you 
  are spoken with.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> After we respond to your 
  note, we will set your character up on the builder's port, to include commands, 
  OLC security, and a spot with the OLC school. At the OLC School, you will build 
  up to three rooms, one mobile, and two to three objects of varying types, to 
  teach and test your skills. After OLC school, we will ask you what area you 
  would like to try to build. There will be a wide variety to choose from, as 
  we are trying to fill the MUD world with original, Eddings-based areas.</font></p>
