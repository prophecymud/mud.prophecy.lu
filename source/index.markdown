{{ site.description }}

Prophecy has been around since 1995 and is still growing. It is based on the Belgariad saga by David and Leigh Eddings and runs with a heavily modified ROM 2.4 code with a lot of unique features, such as our clan system and the by-now famous quest system.

We are constantly adding new areas based on the Belgariad with the help of our brilliant builder staff. The world looks and feels like the world the Eddings couple once created.

Prophecy offers 91 mortal levels and the choice of going PK set at any time. Player Killing is encouraged but restricted to a 10 level range. Roleplaying is also highly encouraged and you are asked to use an unique name for your character in order to retain the MUD's roleplaying atmosphere.

If you have what it takes you may eventually join one of our PK clans and defend your clan's honor either as a Guardian of the West or in the Army of Angaraks. For those who sympathize with neither power there is always the choice of joining the Legions of Neutral or the despised Bear Cult.

Whether you're a returning player or completely new, come join us!
