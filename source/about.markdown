#About Us
Prophecy MUD is a huge, text-based world (+121 original areas) run on heavily modified ROM 2.4 code. Like all traditional MUDs, Prophecy is completely devoid of graphics. This is a feature, not a bug! First-time MUD gamers will be surprised how very engrossing a text-based game can be. Prophecy’s content and gaming style is based on the popular David Eddings fantasy series The Belgariad and The Malloreon. The books serve as the basis for choice of character race, class, and initial alignment. Prophecy MUD is a natural for roleplay, yet also provides opportunities for restricted player killing. A friendly player base and clans dedicated to new player support make Prophecy the perfect beginner’s gateway to MUDs.


#Questing
Prophecy MUD offers games within the game, such as auto-questing to earn customizable gear, experience, and in-game currency. Unique mini-quests can be found in many areas that offer a challenge as well as rich rewards. Finally, there are “Immortal”-hosted quests for added amusement and coveted prizes. 


#On-going Development
Prophecy MUD was officially ported to the Go language in December 2019 after years of development, facilitating continuous improvement and ensuring stable gameplay for years to come. Prophecy MUD manager "King Anheg” is keeping busy with new changes such as elective ‘hometowns’, ooc buffer retrieval for catching up on the latest public discussions, and other Good Things(TM) !


#Former Players Welcome
Are you a Prophecy MUD “veteran”? Drop in and check the place out–we love seeing returning players, and there's a very good chance you'll be recognized and welcomed accordingly. If you ever built an area here, it’s most likely still in use. We’re a no-pwipe MUD, so your character(s), hostel room stash, and quest eq are right where you left them.
